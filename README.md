# **Glymo: A Foundational Model for Type 1 Diabetes Glucose Dynamics**

Glymo is an advanced machine learning project designed to revolutionize the understanding and prediction of glucose dynamics in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). By leveraging self-supervised learning on large-scale Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data, Glymo creates a foundational model that captures general glucose trends such as circadian rhythms, postprandial spikes, and basal glucose oscillations.

In its second stage, Glymo is tailored to predict glucose trends around exercise, factoring in individual criteria such as age, BMI, HbA1c, insulin modality, exercise intensity, and meal timing. This powerful tool aims to support personalized diabetes management and enhance research applications in T1D care.
